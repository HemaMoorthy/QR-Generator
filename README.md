# QRCode-Generator

QR means Quick Response
QR Codes creation and functionality

Creation:
1.) Block Creation (Data encoding) - When we upload our information like (website URL, message etc.) to be encoded on bar code generator software, data is created into small blocks by mathematical algorithms
2.) Error Correction - Redundant data (originally covered in blocks) is generated to help recover original information if original QR code is partially damaged or obscured
3.) Positioning (Uniqueness) - Above combined data is then combined and positioned into black and white unique square pattern to ensure uniqueness and readability by the QR code readers

Functioning:
1.) Scanning - Device camera captures the QR code image
2.) Decoding - The QR code reader software analyses the pattern and decodes the data inside in the readable binary format
3.) Redirection/Display - End result flashed in front of the user
